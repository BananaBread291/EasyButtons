<h1 align="center">Easy Buttons</h1>
<p  align="center"> Easy Buttons is a prefab, that is made for people who aren't familiar with coding. </p>

<h1 align="center">Why I made this</h1>
<p  align="center">Some of my friends still use 2.0 because 3.0 is very difficult, if you don't know how to use U # or Graph, I have made a more simple system.
With prefabs where names are similar Udon can cause compiling errors, With my system this doesn't happen. This is because I added qualifiers to the names to keep things organized.</p>

<h1 align="center">How it works</h1>
<p  align="center">Using a main Udon Script that calls on a different Udon Script. This will run with the settings from the main Script, if the main script is set to global it will run the script that has been made to function globally. This can be done by checking a box!</p>
